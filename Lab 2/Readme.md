The codes of my course Parallel and Distributed Computing using Open MP based
on for loops


## Description

- **Code 1 -** Program to take input of two arrays and add them using parallel for of open MP.

- **Code 2 -** Program to Printing the sum of values using firstprivate and without firstprivate 
- **Code 3 -** Program to parallel calculate the sum of the factors of n numbers starting from 2. Each thread will calculate its sum and show its sum and the total sum of n numbers factors will be displayed at the end.
- **Code 4 -** Program to calculate the count of the odd and even numbers along with their respective sum
