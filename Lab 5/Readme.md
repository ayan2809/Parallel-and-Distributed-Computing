## Lab 4 Submissions

The codes of my course Parallel and Distributed Computing using Open MP based
on the three types of scheduling algorithms that is static, dynamic and guided


## Description

- **Code 1 -** Implement parallel for using static schedule construct in open mp and finding compare with varying task size of the thread.
- **Code 2 -** Implement parallel for using dynamic schedule construct in open MP and finding compare with varying task size of the thread.
- **Code 3 -** Write a program to parallel calculate the sum of the factors of n numbers starting from 2. Each thread will calculate its sum and show its sum and the total sum of n numbers factors will be displayed at the end. Implement using a scheduling technique.
- **Code 3 -** Write a program to calculate the count of the odd and even numbers along with their respective sum using all three types of scheduling techniques (static and dynamic). 
- **Code 3 -** Using the section constructs try to find an array of prime numbers for a given input of n and do it using the scheduling algorithm of static, dynamic and guided for very large numbers.
